# ELEC1601_Boe_Bot_Line_Tracker
This is a group project for USyd's ELEC1601 course. It involves a robot navigating an obstacle course and a black line. 

## Credits and contributions
The template for the code (essentially the whole bluetooth setup for both the master and slave modules) is provided by the instructors of ELEC1601 on USyd's Canvas site.

Within the template, Steve Chang and Ross Hutton are also credited for contributions by the ELEC1601 instructors. This can be seen in the header of both .ino files. 

Some code snippets have also been taken from Parallax Inc., and adapted to suit the project's requirements. These adaptations were carried out by the team members of ELEC1601_M09_11 and ELEC1601_M09_16 (which eventually merged into one group). The team members consisted of: Ehab El Cheikh, James Jun, Haowen Lan, Bernard Tam, Jing Weng and Yilin Zhang. 

The aforementioned code snippets come from the folllowing pages:
